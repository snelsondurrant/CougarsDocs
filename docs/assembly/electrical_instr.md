## Main COUG-UV PCB

Open the .brd and .sch files (found below) in a PCB design software. For our purposes we will use Eagle.

For our PCB production we used JLCPCB. In order to process the file correctly for JlCPCB you must first download their custom CAM processor. [Custom Eagle JLCPCB CAM](https://jlcpcb.com/help/article/9-How-to-Generate-Gerber-and-Drill-Files-in-Autodesk-Eagle)

Now return to Eagle under the the .brd tab. Within the toolbar line across the top you will see the cam processor. Open ie and load in the custom processor you downloaded earlier. When it is run you will end up with a .zip file which you will upload to the JLCPCB website.

{: .note }
> download and put these files in the same folder. This is essential for PCB design software like Eagle to recognize they go together.

## Strobe Light PCB

Utilizing the same method as above, you can send out the strobe light PCB for production. (Link found below)
